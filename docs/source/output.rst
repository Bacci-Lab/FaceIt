Output
====================

Output generated by the FaceProject pipeline, including file formats and data structures.

Output Format:
-------------
- **.png** :Processed images saved as `.png` files.

- **faceit.npz** : The data generated by faceIt is saved as a compressed .npz file (NumPy's archive format), named faceit.npz, and is stored in the application's designated save path.
  This .npz file contains various arrays that capture the results of the face and pupil analysis performed by the application.
  The saved .npz file contains the following key data arrays:
   - *pupil_center* : X and Y coordinates of the pupil center for each frame.
   - *pupil_center_X* and *pupil_center_y* : Separated X and Y coordinates of the pupil center.
   - *final_pupil_area*:  The area of the detected pupil in each frame, representing dilation.
   - *X_saccade* and *Y_saccade* : Updated coordinates for X and Y fast pupil movements.
   - *pupil_distance_from_corner* : The distance of the pupil center from the eye corner.
   - *width* and *height* : Width and height of the detected pupil region.
   - *motion_energy* : A measurement of motion energy related to whisker pad data across frames.

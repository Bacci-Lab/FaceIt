# FaceIt - Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install **FaceIt**, ensuring a clean setup with **Python 3.9** 

## üìå Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the installation, ensure that **Python 3.9** is installed on your system. If it's not available, download and install **Python 3.9** separately from your system's default Python using the link below:  

üîó [Download Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)  

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- **Do not check** the option **"Add python.exe to PATH"** during installation to avoid conflicts with your system's default Python.
- If you prefer an isolated setup, select **"Customize Installation"** and **specify a dedicated directory** for Python 3.9.
- **Remember the installation path**, as you'll need it later to configure the environment.

---

### üîπ Step 1: Clone the Repository
We recomend you to use git to clone into your local computer. If you have git open CMD terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/faezehrabbani/FaceIt.git
```
If Git is not installed on your system, you can download and install it from the link below:
üîó [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### üîπ Alternative: Download the Repository Manually

If you don‚Äôt have **Git** installed, you can manually download the repository by following these steps:

1. In the FaceIt Github click on the **"Code"** button (green button).

2. Select **"Download ZIP"**.

3. Extract the ZIP file to your preferred location.

4. Inside the extracted directory, you will find a folder named "FaceIt-main".
Open it and rename the "FaceIt-main" folder inside it to "FaceIt".
Move the FaceIt folder outside of FaceIt-main.
Now, your directory structure should look like this:

```bash
C:\your_preferred_directory\FaceItt
```

### üîπ Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd FaceIt
```


### üîπ Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Using Python 3.9)


If Python 3.9 is not your system's default version, you need to specify its full installation path to create the virtual environment. Use the following command, replacing "C:\path\to\python3.9\python.exe" with the actual location of your Python 3.9 installation:

```bash
"C:\your path to python 3.9\Python39\python.exe" -m venv FaceIt

```
### üîπ Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment to install and run the pipeline without conflicts:

```bash
FaceIt\Scripts\activate
```

### üîπ Step 5: Install FACEIT
With the virtual environment activated, install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

Once installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
faceit
```
If the faceit command is not recognized, try:

```bash
python -m FACEIT_codes.main
```




## üîÑ FaceIt: Daily Workflow

Follow these steps whenever you want to use FaceIt for analysis.

### üîπ Step 1: Navigate to the FaceIt Directory
Before running the application, open the terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and move to the FaceIt project folder:

```bash
cd FaceIt
```
### üîπ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Since FaceIt runs inside a virtual environment, it must be activated before use.

```bash
FaceIT\Scripts\activate
```
### üîπ Step 3: Run FaceIt
Once the environment is active, start the application by typing:

```bash
faceit
```

experimental procedures followed French and European guidelines for animal experimentation and in compliance with the institutional animal welfare guidelines of the Paris Brain Institute

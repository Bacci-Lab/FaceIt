# FaceIt - Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install **FaceIt**, ensuring a clean setup with **Python 3.9** in a separate directory.

### ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before installing, make sure you have:
- **Python 3.9** installed separately from your system Python:  
  ðŸ”— [Download Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)
- **Git** installed:  
  ðŸ”— [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open CMD terminal and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/faezehrabbani/FaceIt.git
```
### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
```bash
cd FaceIt
```


### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (Using Python 3.9)


If Python 3.9 is not your system's default version, you need to specify its full installation path to create the virtual environment. Use the following command, replacing "C:\path\to\python3.9\python.exe" with the actual location of your Python 3.9 installation:

```bash
"C:\your path to python 3.9\Python39\python.exe" -m venv FaceIt

```
### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment to install and run the pipeline without conflicts:

```bash
FaceIt\Scripts\activate
```

### ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Install FACEIT
With the virtual environment activated, install the package:

```bash
pip install .
```

Once installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
faceit
```
If the faceit command is not recognized, try:

```bash
python -m FACEIT_codes.main
```




## ðŸ”„ FaceIt: Daily Workflow

Follow these steps whenever you want to use FaceIt for analysis.

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Navigate to the FaceIt Directory
Before running the application, open the terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and move to the FaceIt project folder:

```bash
cd FaceIt
```
### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Since FaceIt runs inside a virtual environment, it must be activated before use.

```bash
FaceIT\Scripts\activate
```
### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Run FaceIt
Once the environment is active, start the application by typing:

```bash
faceit
```

experimental procedures followed French and European guidelines for animal experimentation and in compliance with the institutional animal welfare guidelines of the Paris Brain Institute
